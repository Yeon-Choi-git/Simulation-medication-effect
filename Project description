# How to handle measurements affected by medication use
This project is to investigate how to handle measurements affected by medication use (e.g., blood pressure values alleviated by antihypertensive medication use) in observational studies. Medication use is a common type of intercurrent events in epidemiological studies. 


With a series of simulations, we compare several available methods for handling medication use. The problem can be seen from multiple perspective:
- missing data? the counter factual under no medication use is missing.
- measurement error? some people's blood pressure is measured systematically lower
- censored data? underlying blood pressure is higher than it is observed
- selection bias? people with certain characteristics use medication

Scenarios vary based on whether the exposure, the outcome or a confounder is affected by medication use. 


Originally, we borrow several covariates directly from the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity (NEO). Due to privacy concern, here, I modified the data.
